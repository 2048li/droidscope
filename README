DroidScope
==========

Introduction
------------

DroidScope is a simple Android client for the Pulse Continuous Integration
Server:

http://zutubi.com/products/pulse/

It provides basic abilities to view the health of your Pulse projects and their
latest builds.

Using DroidScope
----------------

The first time you start DroidScope, it will prompt you for details of a Pulse
server.  Once these details are provided, the main DroidScope view will display
a list of all projects on the server - with their current health indicated by a
coloured icon.  Projects that are currently building will have an animated icon.

To view more details for a particular project, simply touch the project's name.
For further options, use the menus or long-touch a project name.

Caveats
-------

DroidScope is far from a full-blown Pulse client.  Notable weaknesses include:

  * No notification support.  DroidScope is currently designed as a client,
    rather than a monitor of a Pulse server.  There is no way, e.g., to be
    notified of new builds.
  * No project limit.  If you point the client at a server with hundreds of
    projects, it will naively try to load information on them all.

Acknowledgements
----------------

  * DroidScope uses icons from the free sets at http://www.androidicons.com/.
